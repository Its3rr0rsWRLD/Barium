Barium is a simple anti-cheat for Minecraft. I just made it because I was bored :3

## Features

- **Basic Detection** - Detects common hacks like reach, [freecam](#freecam), and more (more features to be added).
- **Alert System** - Alerts admins when potential cheating behavior is detected.
- **Configurable** - Fully configurable settings to adjust the sensitivity and actions taken.

## Installation

1. Download the Simple Anti-Cheat.jar file from the Releases section.
2. Drop the file into your `plugins` folder in your Spigot server directory.
3. Restart your server.
4. Edit the `config.yml` file generated in the `plugins/Barium` folder to customize settings.

## Usage

Once installed, the plugin will automatically monitor player actions for potential cheats. Adjust the `config.yml` for more control over what actions are monitored and the thresholds for detection.

# More Information

## Freecam
Q: What do you mean by freecam detection?

A: If someone tries to use freecam or anything similar to (for example) mine a block that is not in their line of sight (LoS), Barium will detect and take action against the user

## Configurability
Q: How configurable is it?

A: Barium comes with a config.yml file that lets you configure different actions for different cheats, as well as some numbers that can change distance, speed, etc.
